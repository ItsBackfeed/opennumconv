# Open Numeral System Converer (ONSC)

## ONSC is NOT useable at it current State !

### What is ONSC ?

*ONSC* allows you to converte numbers from one numeral system into another.
It is currently a work in progress, but I plan on finishing it around May 
2021. I am farely new to C programming and open source projects, this in 
fact is my first public project, however I will try to write as clean and
well documented Code as possible. If there are any bugs you would like to
have fixed, just report it. I will then try to fix it as soon as possible.
